# 🏠 HBnB Project

Welcome to the HBnB project! A full-stack clone of the AirBnB web application, built to demonstrate learned capabilities of backend and frontend development, object-oriented programming, and deployment.

## 📖 Description

HBnB is a web-based application that allows users to create, update, and manage listings of places to stay. It mimics the core functionality of AirBnB, including user authentication, listing creation, and changes based on user interaction or data.

## 🏗️ Project Overview

### 📚 V1 – Documentation Foundation

This phase defines the architecture and business logic for HBnB Evolution.

- Core entities: User, Place, Review, Amenity
- Business rules and relationships
- Layered architecture: Presentation, Business Logic, Persistence
- UML diagrams: package, class, and API sequences

The goal is to produce clear, implementation-ready documentation that guides development in later stages.


### 🧩 V2 – Core Application Logic

Implements HBnB Evolution’s backend using Python and Flask.

- Core models (User, Place, Review, Amenity)
- RESTful API endpoints with flask-restx.
- Layered architecture with facade pattern.
- Data serialization and validation.
- Unittests for facade and endpoints.
